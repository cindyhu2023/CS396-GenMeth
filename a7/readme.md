## DNA art
Draw a DNA structure with 2 sin waves as the backbones and lines as bonds in between

###Sliders:
1. DNA length: length of the DNA. allows the DNA to grow taller or shorter.
2. DNA size: resize the DNA. allows the DNA to expand or shirk proportionally.
3. angle offset: "phase shift" in the sin wave function. shift the whole DNA structure vertically.
4. back bone color (left): color of the left side of the back bone
5. back bone color (right): color of the right side of the back bone  
6. back bone thickness: thickness of the back bone
7. bond color (left): color of the left side of the bond in between the backbone
8. bond color (right): color of the right side of the bond in between the backbone
9. bond thickness: thickness of the bond
10. bond gap: the distance in between two bonds
