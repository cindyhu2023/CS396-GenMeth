# Cindy Hu - A5

This chatbot is based on Janet from the show The Good Place. Many of the lines are directly from the show. If you see something that makes no sense, it definitely is from the show. (If you have never watched it, I highly recommend it! And sorry if this spoiled something if you are in the middle of watching it.)

Introduction of the show from IMDB:
"The Good Place is a town where those who have been good throughout their lives go once they have passed away. Michael is the architect who oversees the town--and this is the first one he has been in charge of creating. Eleanor arrives at the Good Place and realizes they have her name right, but everything else is wrong. She isn't meant to be there at all. With the help of Chidi, her soul mate, Eleanor tries to right her wrongs, seeking to finally earn her spot in the Good Place."

Command 1: frozen yogurt!
Randomly recommend you two frozen yogurt flavors, one is normal and the other one is bizarre.

Command 2: let's do something/ I am bored
You will randomly do something that'll either give you points or minus points. The point system decided where you go after you die.

Command 3: where will I go after I die?
If you have >= 0 points, you will go to the Good Place! If you have < 0 points, you are going to the Bad Place for eternal torture.

Command 4: life advice?
Some lines from the show. Hopefully cheers you up or motivates you a little bit.

Command 5: i am hungry
Randomly recommend you a restaurant at the Good Place neighborhood.

Command 6: what time is it?
Tell you the current time on the Jeremy Bearimy timeline.

Command 7: i want to talk to Eleanor/Chidi/Jason/Tahani/Michael/Shawn.
One of the most hilarious/iconic/relatable lines from the character.

Command 8: this is the bad place!
If you have watched the show, you know what will happen. ðŸ˜‰
(Spoiler alert: you will lose your memory!)
